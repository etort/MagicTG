Read me file for MagicTG beta

DEPENDENCIES:
python 2.7
pygame
numpy
Beautifulsoup4


INSTRUCTIONS:
First create a folder in root directory called 'cache'. The program will store the card images here. Feel free to delete it's contents after using the program.

To test the beta, run main.py in a python console

The arrow keys move the red selector, escape exits the program, and enter is the action button.

Currently the program can draw cards if the library is selected and play lands from your hand. The next step, I will implement an expand feature that zooms in on the card when the action button is pressed and options are given such as tap, discard, exile, etc.
